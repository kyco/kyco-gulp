Simple and awesome gulp setup demo.

Take a look at the [blog post](http://www.kycosoftware.com/blog/article/simple-and-awesome-gulp-setup) to get a top down explanation of what's going on here.

How to install
--------------

Download or clone the repo into a folder on your dev environment. Set up some basic vhost or whatever floats your goat to get it up and running.

Basically you will have to run these two commands before anything remotely interesting can happen:

	bower install
	npm install

After that you'll want to run <code>gulp yo</code> to start the default task.
	
Once that is done go to the page where this magic happens in your browser and hit the LiveReload plugin button ([firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remotelivereload/?src=search), [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en)).

Go ahead and do your awesome coding :). Watch the gulp tasks compress and minify your js and stylsheets. LiveReload will make sure everything runs like bliss when you change either your js, sass or html.
