#### Version: 1.0.0

Simple and awesome gulp setup demo.

Take a look at the [blog post](https://kyco.io/blog/simple-and-awesome-gulp-setup) to get an explanation of what's going on here.

How to install
--------------

    Download or clone the repo

Set up a basic vhost or run some sort of dev server.

Basically you will have to run these two commands before anything remotely interesting can happen:

	bower install
	npm install

After that you'll want to run <code>gulp yo</code> to start the default task.

Once that is done go to the page where this magic happens in your browser and hit the LiveReload plugin button ([firefox extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/remotelivereload/?src=search), [chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/livereload/jnihajbhpnppcggbcgedagnkighmdlei?hl=en)).

Go ahead and do your awesome coding :)

Watch the gulp tasks compress and minify your js and stylsheets. LiveReload will make sure everything runs like bliss when you change either your js, sass or html.
